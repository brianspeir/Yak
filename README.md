What could be better than Bundles, Defaults and Dot-Files?
Scripts to make them even easier.

Yak scripts ease everything on the Mac platform.

Copy, Paste and Install from the command-line.

curl -s https://raw.github.com/brianspeir/YAK/master/[Bundles, Defaults, Dot-Files] | bash

Standard installers made better.
