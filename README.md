What could be better than Bundles, Defaults and Dot-Files?
Scripts to make them even easier.

Yak scripts ease everything on the Mac platform.

Copy, Paste and Install from the command-line.

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianspeir/YAK/master/Bundles)
```

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianspeir/YAK/master/Dot-Files)
```

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianspeir/YAK/master/Defaults)
```

Standard installers made better.
